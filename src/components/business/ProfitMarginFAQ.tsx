      id: "what-is-profit-margin",
      question: "What is profit margin?",
      answer: "Profit margin is a financial metric that measures how much profit a company makes for every dollar of revenue. It's expressed as a percentage and calculated by dividing profit by revenue. A higher profit margin indicates better financial efficiency."
    },
    {
      id: "profit-vs-markup",
      question: "What's the difference between profit margin and markup?",
      answer: "Profit margin is calculated based on selling price (profit รท selling price), while markup is calculated based on cost price (profit รท cost price). For example, if you buy for $100 and sell for $150, your markup is 50% but your profit margin is 33.3%."
    },
    {
      id: "good-profit-margin",
      question: "What is considered a good profit margin?",
      answer: "Good profit margins vary by industry. Generally, a net profit margin of 10% is considered average, 20% is high, and 5% is low. Service businesses typically have higher margins (15-20%) than retail businesses (2-6%)."
    },
    {
      id: "improve-profit-margin",
      question: "How can I improve my profit margins?",
      answer: "You can improve profit margins by: increasing prices, reducing costs, improving operational efficiency, focusing on higher-margin products/services, negotiating better supplier terms, or reducing waste and overhead expenses."
    },
    {
      id: "gross-vs-net-margin",
      question: "What's the difference between gross and net profit margin?",
      answer: "Gross profit margin only considers direct costs (cost of goods sold), while net profit margin includes all expenses including overhead, taxes, and interest. Net profit margin gives a more complete picture of overall profitability."
